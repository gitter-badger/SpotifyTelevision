    - Today I was able to rewrite the design and some other features of the application. I rewrote the Design using Material design and angular, I cached the client credientials, and I looked over some other data. 
    - Still todo: I need to cache the local data of the user spotify data. 
    - I also need to paginate playlists + songs of playlists
    - I also need to convert UI to be a responsive UI grid
    - I also need to make the credentials available from a service and not stored in the UI.
